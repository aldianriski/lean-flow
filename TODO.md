# lean-flow — Development Tracker

> **How to use this file**
> - **Session start** — `/prime`; read this before touching code.
> - **`/triage`** grooms the Backlog (re-rank, state, route rejects to `.out-of-scope/`).
> - **`/lean-doc-generator promote`** forms a sprint from `ready` Backlog tasks → `docs/sprint/`.
> - **`/orchestrator sprint-bulk`** builds it; **`/lean-doc-generator close`** runs the Retro → §10 routing.
> - Tech Debt lives in root **`TECH-DEBT.md`**: `TD-NNN`, never deleted; aged at promote (≥3 sprints → re-review; `high` → auto P1).

## Active Sprint

> _(no active sprint)_ — SPRINT-068 closed 2026-08-15 → [`docs/sprint/archive/SPRINT-068-open-the-standard.md`](docs/sprint/archive/SPRINT-068-open-the-standard.md). Next: `/lean-doc-generator promote` — EPIC-003's opening ruling has landed (ADR-023), so the first extraction sprint can promote.
>
> **Roadmap** → [`docs/epic/INDEX.md`](docs/epic/INDEX.md). Four sequenced epics (ADR-018):
> **EPIC-002 Make Room (closed 2026-08-15)** → **EPIC-003 The Standard** (next — its opening
> ruling landed as ADR-023 at SPRINT-068; extraction sprints are the members) →
> **EPIC-004 Conformance** → **EPIC-005 Fleet**. Evidence base:
> [`docs/research/platform-readiness-audit.md`](docs/research/platform-readiness-audit.md).
> Backlog below is ranked against that sequence, not by age.

## Backlog

<!-- Groomed by /triage. Only `ready` tasks are promotable. -->

### P0 — Critical / Blocking

### P1 — Next Phase Required

<!-- EPIC-002 Make Room — the critical path. These block EPIC-003/004/005, which have nowhere to
     write their rules while both SSOT files sit at cap. -->

### P2 — Quality / Polish

- [ ] TASK-212 — Guard the two Layers-family checkers against bare invocation  [size: S] [risk: low] [AFK]
      class:      execution
      done-when:  `check-layers-completeness.sh` and `check-layers-observed.sh` invoked with no
                  arguments print a "nothing verified" note (their guarded siblings' shape) instead
                  of a silent exit-0 no-op, with a must-FAIL/must-note leg per checker proving it
      touches:    scripts/lib/check-layers-completeness.sh · scripts/lib/check-layers-observed.sh ·
                  evals/ (the proving legs)
      depends-on: none
      assumes:    TD-056's family scan (SPRINT-068 T2) is the scope ruling — exactly these two
                  checkers share the silent bare no-op; the cure is per-checker, matching the
                  `check-gates-signed.sh` note-line shape. Gate path unaffected (qa-check.sh always
                  supplies arguments)
      tracker:    TD-056 (family scoped 2026-08-15) · SPRINT-068 T2 scan
      origin:     close-retro
      state:      ready

- [ ] TASK-188 — Exercise the reaper on a genuinely partial Plan  [size: S] [risk: low] [HITL]
      class:      execution
      done-when:  a real unattended run that stops mid-Plan leaves a rollup naming the untouched tasks
                  as `unattempted`, verified end-to-end through `scripts/night-run.sh` rather than via
                  `--reap`
      touches:    scripts/night-run.sh (only if the exercise finds a defect) · a sprint Execution Log
      depends-on: none
      assumes:    **carried from SPRINT-060 T5, acceptance unmet — read the ruling before re-promoting.**
                  The trigger is OPPORTUNISTIC and that is the whole design: the next night run that
                  stops mid-Plan *for its own reasons* is the exercise. Do not schedule a run to produce
                  one, and do not promote this into a sprint whose shape cannot generate it — SPRINT-060
                  promoted it alongside four HITL tasks, the run mode was then ruled interactive at G2,
                  and that foreclosed the only vehicle it had (L-111). Its partial-Plan path is already
                  proven three ways that each stop short of the others: a real log through `--reap`, a
                  zero-ticked-box regression, and an end-to-end launcher run against a complete Plan
      tracker:    SPRINT-060 T5 scope-change + owner ruling · ADR-016 · L-111
      origin:     close-retro
      state:      blocked

### P3 — Long-term

> Rejected work lives in **`.out-of-scope/`** — each file carries its own reasoning, revisit-if and
> expiry, and `/triage` step 1 scans that directory before keeping any resembling task. The per-task
> pointer lines that used to sit here were breadcrumbs to those files, pruned under §11's TODO cap on
> the same reasoning §11 uses for shipped Backlog entries — the durable home is the `.out-of-scope/`
> file, plus git. Ids stay monotonic: 006 · 007 · 040 · 047 · 120 · 148 are not reused.

## Tech Debt

> Moved → **`TECH-DEBT.md`** (root) — split 2026-07-29. Filed at Sprint Close, aged at Sprint Promote.

---

## Changelog (current sprint only)

> Move to root `CHANGELOG.md` once reflected in docs, then delete here.

_(no active sprint)_ — SPRINT-068's shipped changes are written up as **v1.42.0** in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), and the MINOR bump landed with the close (all four manifests + README footer). §11's keep-current-plus-previous rule is satisfied: **v1.42.0 + v1.41.0** inline, with **v1.40.0 rotated** → [`docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-1.40.0.md`](docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-1.40.0.md) in the same commit.

## Quick Rules

```
- Curated, not copied: nothing ships unreviewed; agents/hooks held to the same bar.
- Leverage built-ins (goal/plan/batch/loop/run/verify/code-review/security-review/Explore); ship no duplicates.
- ADRs: rich, one file per docs/adr/ADR-NNN; offered only when hard-to-reverse + surprising + a real trade-off.
- Concise reporting: terse by default; full sentences only where a caveat is load-bearing.
```
