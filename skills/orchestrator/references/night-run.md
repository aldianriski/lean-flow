# Night-run — pre-flight + trigger recipe for unattended `sprint-bulk`

Read before firing `sprint-bulk` unattended overnight. The mechanism is already decided — headless
`claude -p`, OS-scheduled, `--permission-mode dontAsk` + a pre-built scoped allowlist, never
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` (decision record: the lean-flow repo's `docs/research/night-run.md`).
This file is the operational procedure, not a re-decision.

## Part 0 — The unattended contract (read first)

What the run may do when nobody is watching. Everything below Part 0 is procedure; this part is the
rule the procedure serves.

**Mode signal — declared, never inferred.** The trigger prompt carries the word `unattended`
(`claude -p "/orchestrator sprint-bulk unattended" …`). No signal → the run treats itself as
interactive. There is no reliable in-session test for "is a human watching", and a wrong guess is
unsafe in *both* directions — a false AFK self-approves, a false HITL stalls — so it is an explicit
input, never a deduction.

**Absence ≠ consent.** Under `dontAsk` every prompting tool call is auto-denied and the session never
waits — so an `AskUserQuestion` raised at a gate comes back **denied, not answered**. A denial, a
timeout, or a missing human is a **BLOCK**. Never a default-yes, never "proceed with the recommended
option", never self-approval. This is the invariant the rest of this file exists to protect: if
anything here appears to conflict with it, this wins.

**The derivation rule** — the boundary is *derived*, not memorized, so a step that never made the
table below still resolves:

> **AFK-safe** = additive **+** reversible **+** already-approved-in-scope
> **HITL** = approval · judgement · lossy/destructive · scope-changing

**Boundary table** (the rule's worked output — not its definition):

| Step | Unattended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| G1 / G2 sign-off | ✅ **only if** pre-signed at pre-flight over the frozen Plan | already-approved-in-scope |
| Residual grill · any `AskUserQuestion` | ⛔ park | approval |
| `promote` governance sign-off | ⛔ park | judgement + scope-changing (it *forms* the Plan) |
| `promote` sprint render · `plan locked` commit | ⛔ park | downstream of the sign-off above |
| Per-task Implement → self-review → commit → tick DoD | ✅ | additive, inside the approved Plan |
| Execution Log append | ✅ | additive |
| `close` Retro + four-bucket auto-file + `close_commit` | ✅ | additive bookkeeping, no approval gate |
| `close` §11 retention (archive · move · prune · compact) | ⛔ park | lossy |
| `close` doc-freshness propose→approve | ⛔ park | approval |
| `/triage` re-rank · state change · reject apply | ⛔ park | approval |
| `migrate` / `init` per-item approvals | ⛔ park | approval + lossy |
| Mid-sprint `scope-change` re-confirm G2 | ⛔ park | scope-changing |
| `release-patch` push | ⛔ never (unchanged) | outward-facing, owner-reserved |

**Pre-authorization rule.** A gate is pre-signable only if its **subject exists and is frozen** at
pre-flight time. G1/G2 over a promoted Plan qualify — the Plan froze at `promote`. Nothing whose
content the *run itself* produces qualifies: a Retro not yet written cannot be approved in advance.
That is precisely why the charter is **execute-only** — a night run executes a promoted Plan; it does
not decide what the Plan should be, and it does not dispose of what the Plan produced.

**Park protocol.** On reaching a ⛔ step:

1. **Don't ask** (the answer would be a denial) and **don't decide**.
2. **Write the park record** — one rollup line (Part 4) in the sprint Execution Log. No sprint file to
   write into (e.g. parked at `promote`) → the record goes in the `/handoff` doc instead.
3. **Continue disjoint AFK work** — anything with no shared file and no `depends-on` against the
   parked unit, per the G2 overlap map. Same-owner, shared-file, or dependent work parks *with* it.
4. **Clean halt** when no AFK work remains — finish through `/handoff` so the morning `/prime` reads
   it in. Never idle-spin waiting for an input that cannot arrive.
5. **Never work around the park** — rewriting, splitting, or narrowing a task so it dodges the gate is
   itself scope-changing, and therefore HITL. Park it as-is.

## Part 1 — Pre-flight pass (run interactively, the evening before)

All items must pass or the night-run does not fire:

- [ ] Charter confirmed **execute-only**: this run executes a promoted Plan. Anything needing
      `promote`-, `close`-retention-, or `triage`-class approval is parked by design (Part 0), not
      attempted — if the sprint isn't promoted yet, promote it *now*, interactively, or don't fire.
- [ ] Trigger carries the explicit `unattended` signal (Part 0).
- [ ] Active sprint exists; § Plan is frozen (true since `promote`); every task in the run is
      AFK-class — none needs a human mid-execution.
- [ ] Batch G1 + G2 already signed off by the human (per `sprint-bulk` steps 1–2).
- [ ] Zero open `assumes:` / `needs-info` tasks in the run — G2 already blocks on this; pre-flight
      re-verifies it still holds at trigger time (state can drift between G2 and the evening run).
- [ ] Scoped allowlist built from the tasks' `touches:` files plus the commit/review/lint commands
      the run will need, in `--allowedTools` permission-rule syntax (e.g. `Bash(git commit *)`).
      The `fewer-permission-prompts` skill's transcript-scan approach is a candidate builder.
      `dontAsk` **denies** anything outside the list rather than pausing for it — an under-scoped
      allowlist silently fails tasks instead of asking, so this step is load-bearing; over-denial
      shows up in the morning report, never as a bypass.
- [ ] `bypassPermissions` is off the table — never the fallback for a lazy allowlist. The safety
      default stays OFF; flipping it is an owner decision, not a night-run convenience.

## Part 2 — Trigger recipe (consumer-generic)

The one-liner, fired by an OS-level scheduler (outside lean-flow's own surface — it ships no hooks):

```
claude -p "/orchestrator sprint-bulk unattended" --permission-mode dontAsk --allowedTools "<built list>"
```

The `unattended` word is the Part 0 mode signal — without it the run behaves interactively and will
stop at the first gate instead of parking it.

Scheduling variants — the machine must stay on for either:

- **cron (POSIX)**: `0 1 * * * cd /path/to/project && claude -p "/orchestrator sprint-bulk unattended" --permission-mode dontAsk --allowedTools "<built list>" >> night-run.log 2>&1`
- **Windows Task Scheduler**: `schtasks /Create /TN "night-run" /TR "claude -p \"/orchestrator sprint-bulk unattended\" --permission-mode dontAsk --allowedTools \"<built list>\"" /SC DAILY /ST 01:00`

Checkpointing is inherited free from `sprint-bulk` steps 4–5 — no new mechanism: per-task commit +
Execution Log append is the checkpoint; first-blocker-halt parks the blocked task with its unblock
condition and lets disjoint work continue per the G2 parallel map.

**Morning.** Read the sprint file's Execution Log + DoD state — that's the report; no new artifact.
Stall/kill/resume path: Part 3. Rollup line format: Part 4.

## Part 3 — Watchdog (OS-level pattern, ships outside lean-flow's own surface)

A small wrapper the OS scheduler runs alongside Part 2's `claude -p` call — no plugin code, no hook.

- **Stall signal**: no new `stream-json` line and no new commit for N minutes (default ≈20–30 min,
  scaled to the run's task size — raise for large/slow tasks, lower for small ones).
- **On stall**: SIGTERM the `claude -p` process — it runs `SessionEnd` then exits 143 (confirmed in
  `docs/research/night-run.md` Findings), the same clean-exit path a closed terminal triggers.
- **Recovery**: the kill handler fires one final `claude -p --resume <session-id> "/handoff"` so the
  handoff doc lands in the OS temp dir exactly as a human-ended session would.
- **Shape** (pseudo): `every K min → if idle > N min → SIGTERM → wait for exit 143 → claude -p
  --resume <session-id> "/handoff"`.
- **Resume**: next session opens with `/prime`, which already reads a referenced handoff doc — no
  new resume mechanism.

## Part 4 — Morning rollup (rides the Execution Log, no new artifact)

The first thing the morning human reads: one line per non-green task, appended as the run's last
Execution Log entry — written by the run itself on a clean finish, or by the watchdog's `/handoff`
on a stall.

```
Tn · state (done | blocked | parked-hitl | denied-tool | stalled) · unblock condition / next action
```

`parked-hitl` = the run reached a step only a human may take (Part 0) — the line names *which* step
and what resolves it (next: do that one step interactively; the rest of the run already completed
around it). `denied-tool` = `dontAsk` refused a call outside the pre-flight allowlist (next: extend
allowlist, re-run). `stalled` = the watchdog fired (next: resume via `/prime` + the handoff path).
`done` tasks need no line — the rollup is for non-green tasks only.

Distinguish `parked-hitl` from `denied-tool` in the morning: a park is the contract working as
designed and needs a decision; a denial is an under-scoped allowlist and needs a config fix.
